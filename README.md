### When was the company incorporated?
Shopify was founded in 2004. 
### Who are the founders of the company?
Tobias Lutke and Scott Lake founded Shopify. 
### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
After Tobias and Scott had a poor experience attempting to open Snowdevil, an online store for snowboarding equipment. Dissatisfied with the existing e-commerce products on the market, Tobias, a computer programmer by trade, instead built his own. Tobias used the open source web application framework Ruby on Rails to build Snowdevil's online store, and launched it after two months of development. The Snowdevil founders launched the platform as Shopify in June 2006.
### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
The company was largely self-funding until December 2010 when it received $7m from an initial series A round of venture capital raising.
Itâ€™s Series B round received $15 million in October 2011. 
The company received $100 million in Series C funding in December 2013. 
On April 14, 2015, Shopify filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbols "SHOP" and "SH" respectively. Shopify went public on May 21, 2015, and in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, started trading at $28, more than 60% higher than its US$17 offering price, with its IPO raising more than $131 million.---
