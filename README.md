### When was the company incorporated?
Shopify was founded in 2004. 
### Who are the founders of the company?
Tobias Lutke and Scott Lake founded Shopify. 
### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
After Tobias and Scott had a poor experience attempting to open Snowdevil, an online store for snowboarding equipment.  
Dissatisfied with the existing e-commerce products on the market, Tobias, a computer programmer by trade, instead built his own. Tobias used the open source web application framework *Ruby on Rails* to build Snowdevil's online store, and launched it after two months of development.  
The Snowdevil founders launched the platform as Shopify in June 2006.
### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
The company was largely self-funding until December 2010 when it received $7m from an initial series A round of venture capital raising.
It’s Series B round received $15 million in October 2011.   
The company received $100 million in Series C funding in December 2013. 
On April 14, 2015, Shopify filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbols "SHOP" and "SH" respectively. Shopify went public on May 21, 2015, and in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, started trading at $28, more than 60% higher than its US$17 offering price, with its IPO raising more than $131 million.---

## Business Activities:
* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Shopify is an ecommerce platform that empowers its customers to market, sell, transact, ship and manage sales fulfilment. Shopify distinguishes itself in providing solutions for almost any business size – from the smallest one or two entrepreneurs through to large scale enterprises selling millions of dollars merchandise per week. 
Shopify has made “going online” simple, accessible and functionally rich. Its customers can seamlessly receive online orders, receive payments (through a variety of direct and indirect channels) and seamlessly fulfil orders through Amazon or any transport\logistics company. 
The key differentiators of Shopify are its:
•	Ease of use – upwards from the novice online start-up.
•	Scalability in size and complexity of the commercial operations.
•	Use of innovative partnerships with organisations such as Amazon, Facebook 
For examples of how businesses have used Shopify for such please refer to the attached cases studies titled:
1.	HiSmile eclipsed $130 million through influencer marketing and going global. 
2.	
 * Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Shopify offerings are scaled for almost any size business operation providing solutions to 1,000,000 businesses in 175 countries. Any enterprise that wants to operate an online business can use the Shopify ecommerce platform. 
Ecommerce growth continues to be extremely strong and obviously the Covid-19 trend has extenuated this growth. In 2019, retail e-commerce sales worldwide amount to 3.53 trillion US dollars with sales projected to grow to 6.54 trillion by 2022. 
In Australia e-commerce has enjoyed similar growth and is expected to reach $35.2 billion in 2021. 
Indeed, on-line shopping is now one of the most popular online activities worldwide!
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

It is the only software in the world authorised to send Trustpilot to send product ratings in outbound emails. Developers and ecommerce retailers are invited to try to it for free, to establish viability this predictive analytics system is. SwiftERM is a certified Microsoft Partner MPN ID 6197468.
In August 2013, Shopify announced the launch of Shopify Payments, which allowed merchants to accept credit cards without requiring a third-party payment gateway. The company also announced the launch of an iPad-centric point of sale system. It uses an iPad to accept payments from debit and credit cards. The company received $100 million in Series C funding in December 2013.

## Landscape:
* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Shopify is arguably the world lead in the ecommerce domain of the Fintech industry. 
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
The “WebsiteBuilderExpert” site lists 7 top competitors to Shopify being:
1.	BigCommerce
2.	Volusion
3.	WooCommerce
4.	Wix
5.	Squarespace 
6.	Square Online
7.	Weebly
“BigCommerce is Shopify’s biggest competitor due to its huge range of powerful sales features, while Volusion offers great analytics for tracking your store’s data. WooCommerce is self-hosted, which brings technical challenges but gives you more control. Wix is best for smaller businesses looking for greater creative freedom, but Squarespace has the most stunning designs. Square Online takes the cake for value, and Weebly is ideal for entrepreneurs.”

## Results
* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Shopify led the industry for providing accessible, simple and affordable e-commerce platforms for enterprises of any size. It understood the market power and profitability that came by empowering any business enterprise of any size or complexity to become an on-line business. 
Its impact has been profound. Not only did it set an example for similar companies to follow (as example note the list competitor companies above) it has been extremely popular. Over 1,000,000 businesses in 175 countries have made over $200 billion USD in sales using Shopify.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

## Recommendations:
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
My three key recommendations for Shopify are to provide:
1.	Seamless trade finance. That is provide customers with the ability to purchase goods on credit and then provide factor finance once the goods are sold. Thus, reducing the capital requirements for start-ups. 
2.	Increase the solution to provide seamless Warehouse Managements Services (WMS) and Transport Management Services (TMS). Currently this requires integration to third party applications such as Cargo Wise and/or SmartFreight. 
3.	Further to point 2 is to provide enhance automation so an order once picked can be seamlessly managed from picking the order through to shipping, delivery tracking and POD confirmation. 
4.	Provide a blockchain/smart contract solution providing an alternative to the use of letters of credit, US dollars and the Swift payment system. A similar - but far more complex enhancement - to one implemented in August 2013 when it released Shopify payments -which allowed merchants to accept credit cards without requiring a third-party gateway. 
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
The three ideas contained in the previous section would benefit the company by:
1.	Increasing the ease and simplicity of becoming an on-line business through simplified financing requirements. 
2.	Provide a seamless and automated stock management solution 
3.	Facilitate easier international sales and trade by providing 
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
1.	Technologies for an integrated WMS and TMS would be very similar to the technologies already deployed by Shopify. 
2.	Providing trade finance would require similar technology to Shopify payments solutions however would probably require a partnership with a finance company or bank. 
3.	A blockchain/smart contract solution to facilitate international trade would require an substantial and strategic investment in a block chain technology such as Cardano and its Marlowe Playground. 
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
The first two ideas are simply an extension and enhancement of the same technology and business services currently provided by Shopify. 
Cardano’s Marlow playground has been specifically designed to provide functionality in the financial services space. It is a third-generation proof-of-stake blockchain platform. Whilst not the only alternative for Shopify it would be a highly logical choice of technology for such an initiative.
