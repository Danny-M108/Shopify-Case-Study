Tobias Lutke and Scott Lake founded Shopify. 
### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
After Tobias and Scott had a poor experience attempting to open Snowdevil, an online store for snowboarding equipment.  
Dissatisfied with the existing e-commerce products on the market, Tobias, a computer programmer by trade, instead built his own. Tobias used the open source web application framework *Ruby on Rails* to build Snowdevil's online store, and launched it after two months of development.  
The Snowdevil founders launched the platform as Shopify in June 2006.

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Shopify’s key advantage has been its commitment to innovation, technology leadership and leveraging strategic partnerships with organisations such Amazon, Facebook, Snapchat and Apple.  
The key differentiators of Shopify are its:  
  • Ease of use – upwards from the novice online start-up.  
  •	Scalability in size and complexity of the commercial operations.  
  •	Use of innovative partnerships with organisations such as Amazon, Facebook, Alipay and Snapchat.

It has consistently pursued market leadership in the provision of a complete ecommerce eco system for online businesses of all sizes. 
An example of these advantage of this commitment include:  
•	In June 2009, Shopify launched an application programming interface (API) platform and App Store. The API allows developers to create applications for Shopify online stores     and then sell them on the Shopify App Store.  
•	In April 2010, Shopify launched a free mobile app on the Apple App Store. The app lets Shopify store owners view and manage their stores from iOS mobile devices.

•	On May 11, 2017, Shopify acquired Oberlo, which was one of the star applications on its own Shopify App Store. Oberlo connects Shopify merchants with suppliers who ship         products directly to consumers, and was acquired for $15M.

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
In August 2013, Shopify announced the launch of Shopify Payments, which allowed merchants to accept credit cards without requiring a third-party payment gateway.  The company also announced the launch of an iPad-centric point of sale system. It uses an iPad to accept payments from debit and credit cards. 

## Landscape:
### What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Shopify is arguably the world lead in the ecommerce domain of the Fintech industry. 

### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

### What are the other major companies in this domain?
The “WebsiteBuilderExpert” site lists 7 top competitors to Shopify being:
1.	BigCommerce
2.	Volusion
3.	WooCommerce
4.	Wix
5.	Squarespace 
6.	Square Online
7.	Weebly  
“BigCommerce is Shopify’s biggest competitor due to its huge range of powerful sales features, while Volusion offers great analytics for tracking your store’s data. WooCommerce is self-hosted, which brings technical challenges but gives you more control. Wix is best for smaller businesses looking for greater creative freedom, but Squarespace has the most stunning designs. Square Online takes the cake for value, and Weebly is ideal for entrepreneurs.”

#### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

#### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

### Recommendations:
#### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
My three key recommendations for Shopify are to provide:
  1.	Seamless trade finance. That is provide customers with the ability to purchase goods on credit and then provide factor finance once the goods are sold. Thus, reducing the       capital requirements for start-ups. 
  2.	Increase the solution to provide seamless Warehouse Managements Services (WMS) and Transport Management Services (TMS). Currently this requires integration to third party       applications such as Cargo Wise and/or SmartFreight. 
  3.	Further to point 2 is to provide enhance automation so an order once picked can be seamlessly managed from picking the order through to shipping, delivery tracking and POD       confirmation. 
  4.	Provide a blockchain/smart contract solution providing an alternative to the use of letters of credit, US dollars and the Swift payment system. A similar - but far more         complex enhancement - to one implemented in August 2013 when it released Shopify payments -which allowed merchants to accept credit cards without requiring a third-party        gateway. 
#### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
The three ideas contained in the previous section would benefit the company by:
  1.	Increasing the ease and simplicity of becoming an on-line business through simplified financing requirements. 
  2.	Provide a seamless and automated stock management solution 
  3.	Facilitate easier international sales and trade by providing 
#### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
  1.	Technologies for an integrated WMS and TMS would be very similar to the technologies already deployed by Shopify. 
  2.	Providing trade finance would require similar technology to Shopify payments solutions however would probably require a partnership with a finance company or bank. 
  3.	A blockchain/smart contract solution to facilitate international trade would require an substantial and strategic investment in a block chain technology such as Cardano         and its Marlowe Playground.  
#### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
The first two ideas are simply an extension and enhancement of the same technology and business services currently provided by Shopify. 
Cardano’s Marlow playground has been specifically designed to provide functionality in the financial services space. It is a third-generation proof-of-stake blockchain platform. Whilst not the only alternative for Shopify it would be a highly logical choice of technology for such an initiative.
